Climate change, driven largely by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, poses a significant threat to global biodiversity.<br> As temperatures rise and weather patterns become more erratic, ecosystems around the world are facing unprecedented challenges. From the melting ice caps in the Arctic to the bleaching of coral reefs in tropical oceans, the effects of climate change are evident across diverse habitats. Species are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing conditions, leading to shifts in distribution, declines in population numbers, and in some cases, extinction.<br> The loss of biodiversity not only diminishes the resilience of ecosystems but also undermines essential ecosystem services such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration. Addressing the root causes of climate change and implementing conservation strategies are critical steps in safeguarding the rich tapestry of life on Earth for future generations.
