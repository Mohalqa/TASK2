    <h1><u>what is the Introduction to Mathematics</u></h1>
    <p>Mathematics, <mark>often regarded as the language of the universe</mark>, is a discipline that explores patterns, structures, and relationships in the world around us.<br> <u>It provides a systematic framework for logical reasoning and problem-solving,</u> serving as a cornerstone of various fields such as<b> science, engineering, economics</b>, and more.

<h1><u>Introduction to Chemistrt  </u></h1>
<p> hemistry is the scientific discipline concerned with the<u> study of matter, its properties, composition, structure, and the changes it undergoes during</u> <b>chemical </b> reactions.<br> It is often referred to as the central science because it connects and overlaps with other branches of science, including physics, biology, and environmental science.<br> At its core, chemistry seeks to understand the fundamental principles governing the behavior of atoms and molecules, from the simplest compounds to complex organic structures. <br><i> <mark>Through experimentation, observation, and theoretical models</mark></i>, chemists explore the nature of substances and their interactions, paving the way for innovations in materials science, pharmaceuticals, energy production, and environmental sustainability.<br> From understanding the composition of the air we breathe to the development of life-saving drugs,<mark> chemistry </mark> plays a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the natural world and <del>driving technological advancements for the betterment of society</del>.   </p>
