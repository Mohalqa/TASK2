    Semantics: HTML provides semantic markup, which means it gives meaning to the content on a web page. Semantic elements likehelp browsers, search engines, and screen readers understand the structure and purpose of the content.<br>
    Content: HTML focuses on defining the actual content of a web page, including text, images, links, forms, and multimedia elements. It lays the foundation for what the user sees and interacts with on the page.
    <br>
    Accessibility: HTML supports accessibility features such as alt attributes for images, labels for form elements, and semantic elements, making it easier for users with disabilities to navigate and understand web content.

    Presentation: CSS is responsible for styling the visual appearance of HTML elements. It allows you to control aspects like colors, fonts, margins, padding, borders, and backgrounds, enhancing the aesthetics and readability of the content.
    Modularity: CSS promotes modularity by allowing styles to be defined once and applied to multiple elements throughout a website. This reduces redundancy and makes it easier to maintain consistent design across different pages.
    Selective Styling: CSS provides selectors that allow you to target specific HTML elements, classes, IDs, or attributes to apply styles selectively. This level of granularity gives designers precise control over the appearance of individual elements.   </p>
